Description: Combine generalised least squares methodology from the nlme package 
    for dealing with autocorrelation with penalised least squares methods from 
    the glmnet package to deal with high dimensionality. This pengls packages glues 
    them together through an iterative loop. The resulting method is applicable to 
    high dimensional datasets that exhibit autocorrelation, such as spatial or temporal data.
